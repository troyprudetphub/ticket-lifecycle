  After reading through the ticket Jess assigns this as Severity A because this is a business critical outage and should be resolved quickly.
  Afterwards she assigns the ticket to Ben from the Online Banking team.

  As Ben from the Online banking team, I act out the process of contacting the issuer of the ticket and keeping them updated while working
  to resolve the issue. We close the ticket after doing a rollback on the latest update and confirming that the online banking portal
  is once again operational

There was a new ticket claiming that two employees were unable to open up their Adobe software. Jess takes on this ticket and gets in contact with Jane.
After getting in contact with Jane she suggest that the employees to restart the their system to see if that'll resolve the issue. The the two employees
are able to access Adobe Reader after restarting their system and Jess closes the ticket now that the issue is resolved.

In this simulation we receive a ticket that the CFO's laptop is unable to boot up. Not sure on the severity of the situation we assign it an SLA of 
Severity B with the possibility to escalate after receiving more information on the situation. After checking the CFO's laptop she discovers that the laptop
wasn't charged due to a the charger not working properly. After replacing the charger and confirming that the laptop is working she returns the laptop and
equipment to the CFO and closes the ticket.
